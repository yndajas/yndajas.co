<p>I was also the Equality Champion for my department (Registry) and the Secretary of the LGBT Staff Network. My work in this area (in particular that related to LGBT equality) led me to win a Celebrating Exceptional People award (the annual staff awards at York St John University). Whilst Secretary of the LGBT Staff Network, the University became one of six in the country to score 10/10 in Stonewall's University Guide 2015 and made it into Stonewall's top 100 employers for LGB-friendliness in 2015 and 2016 based on the results of their Workplace Equality Index.

The network was named "Awesome" by Inclusive Networks, and York St John University won one of their inaugural awards in 2015 ("Network Champion of the Year"), received a high commendation in the "Collaboration of the Year" category and were finalists in two more categories (one of which was for me in the category "Inspiring Member of the Year").</p>

<h5>YSJActive Graduate Intern</h5>
<p>York St John University, June 2012 - September 2012</p>
<p>YSJActive is a department that offers sports facility hire, a fitness suite, fitness classes and continuing professional development courses. At YSJActive, I carried out a SWOT analysis of the administrative processes, procedures and systems, recommending and then implementing significant improvements that enhanced both functionality and efficiency. In this role, I taught myself how to use Microsoft Access, quickly becoming a relative expert. I redesigned the sports facility hire and fitness suite membership forms and built new databases for each of these two areas that were far easier to use than previous iterations and offered far more functionality. In addition to revitalising the administrative procedures and systems, I served as the main receptionist for the building in which the fitness suite was located and I was responsible for the day to day administrative duties of the team.</p>
