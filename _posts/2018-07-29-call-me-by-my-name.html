<p>It's 4:51 AM
<br>I've been fighting to update my name on a page
<br>For the past five hours
<br>Almost nonstop
<br>Coming up against the rigidity of Wikipedia editors
<br>Or should I say, Wikicops?</p>

<p>Like the police
<br>In a dispute between one of them
<br>And an innocent civilian
<br>They'll always favour their own
<br>Won't listen to reason
<br>Empathy lost
<br>Defend the authorities at all costs</p>

<p>Discuss
<br>Debate
<br>Argue</p>

<p>They say to change my name on a page about an event in 2015 is to change the past
<br>"We can't rewrite history to make one person happy"
<br>"This is a matter of historical accuracy"</p>

<p>Well I'll tell you what's accurate:
<br>Deadnaming can lead to
<br>Gender dysphoria can lead to
<br>Mental distress can lead to
<br>Depression can lead to...
<br>Worse.</p>

<p>And I'll tell you what's accurate:
<br>Throughout history I've been Ynda Jas
<br>Simply known by a label of the past</p>

<p>Yet records are final
<br>You rigidly rule
<br>And for naming this violence
<br>You paint me for a fool</p>

<p>Discuss
<br>Debate
<br>Argue
<br>Cause lost</p>

<p>Call me by my name
<br>Such a simple task</p>

<p>Call me by my name
<br>Is it really so much to ask?</p>
