<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the toxic masculinity, societal anti-femininity and transmisogyny that shapes the way I present
<br>The dresses I would've worn had I not feared the thump and the dent
<br>And the times I look in the mirror and what I see I resent</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the assumptions made about my gender because of the way I speak and look
<br>The killer aesthetic choices I wish I could've <strike>took</strike> taken
<br>And the killer from which society must awaken</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the force that makes me reclusive and my bed my main station
<br>The distance that grows between mind and body in an oppressively cis occasion
<br>And the autopilot to which I anxiously hand over control of such a situation's navigation</p>

<p class="poem-indent">Gender-diverse queer spaces give me life</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the "is that all sir?" in destination retail
<br>The forms that read "Gender: Female or Male"
<br>And the letters addressed "Mr" when I've always put "Mx" - fail</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the use of the "male" toilets to avoid unwanted attention
<br>The (not really) gender-neutral signs made without self-education
<br>And the free emotional labour that has become standard cis expectation</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the "ladies and gentleman" announcement on the Underground
<br>The choice to neglect asking someone their pronouns
<br>And the failure to say a simple sorry when getting it wrong... *frowns*</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the "he", the "boy", the "lad", the "man"
<br>The cis not doing what they can
<br>And the shit they let hit the trans emotional fan</p>

<p class="poem-indent">Gender-diverse queer spaces give me life</p>

<p>Cissexism is everywhere, every day
<br>Cissexism is the expressive freedom we've all been denied
<br>The many times I could've cried and cried
<br>And the times upon times trans people have unnecessarily died</p>
