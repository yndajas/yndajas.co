<p>Fighting anti-trans lesbians
<br>Pretending we hate them
<br>Projecting their transphobia thus
<br>When really they hate us</p>

<p>Moving in herds
<br>Anti-trans sheep
<br>Into our spaces they creep
<br>To claim we threaten theirs</p>

<p>They bend our words
<br>Warp
<br>Distort
<br>Warp
<br>Distort
<br>Transform and twist
<br>Wording bent
<br>Selective quotation
<br>Misrepresent</p>

<p>Fight me
<br>Bite me
<br>I know you'll never like me</p>

<p>But I love me
<br>I love my trans siblings
<br>I love all the radical non-conformists changing the world
<br>With visions of a boundless euphoric utopia
<br>Today we've gotta cope with ya... transphobia
<br>But one day it will be our... cornucopia</p>
