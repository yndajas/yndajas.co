<p>Supportive friends and family
<br>I promise to blossom
<br>Your love is like the finest of fertilisers</p>

<p>Trans siblings
<br>I promise to blossom
<br>Until we're not seen as a disorder, but cherished as a gift</p>

<p>Regressively exlusionary faux-feminists and other transphobes
<br>I promise to blossom
<br>Until you find yourself on the wrong side of history</p>

<p>Haters in the street
<br>I promise to blossom
<br>So that one day you can blossom too</p>
