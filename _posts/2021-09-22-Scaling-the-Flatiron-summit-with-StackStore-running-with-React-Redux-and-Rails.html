<p>Having paced through three projects on Sinatra, Rails and JavaScript earlier in the year, I took a little longer to work through the curriculum and get started on the final Flatiron project, which is focused on React and Redux. After initially
  setting up the Rails API backend a few weeks ago, I took some time refamiliarise myself with the structure and flow of React/Redux apps by watching through the majority of a live build demo. I gradually started building out the structure of the
  app, then - as usual - couldn't stop once I got into the flow of things.</p>

<p class="before-list">The task for the final project is to build a React/Redux app with a Rails API backend. I decided to create StackStore, a simple application for finding, keeping, tagging and making notes on Stack Overflow questions. With
  StackStore, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>search for Stack Overflow questions by title</li>
  <li>view questions and answers</li>
  <li>save questions to your own store</li>
  <li>add tags and notes to questions and view questions by tag</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like a fairly simple app when you list the features - and the entity relationship diagram below is indeed much simpler than my last few apps - but some of the best apps are narrow in scope. The entity relationship diagram below is for the
  API backend; you can also open the diagram as <a href="/assets/resources/StackStore_erd.pdf" target="_blank">a PDF</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>With this app, I was more interested in doing one or a few jobs well than doing lots of jobs. I wanted to make the most of React, Redux and various packages in order to develop a more streamlined and straightforward user experience
  than in previous projects. The use of state, props and components in a React/Redux framework allows you to provide interactive features and responsive data (i.e. retrieval and manipulation) without requiring a bunch of reloads as with a traditional
  model-view-controller app, or highly complex and custom code as with a vanilla JavaScript single page app.</p>

<p class="before-list">The full requirements for the project were as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use of ES6 syntax</li>
  <li>use of <code>create-react-app</code></li>
  <li>one HTML page to render the app - I ended up with two, one of which is a 404 used to run a redirect script (not my own) when GitHub Pages tries to load a route via a non-existent HTML file</li>
  <li>at least five stateless components and three routes - I ended up with many stateless components and seven routes: home/login, about, saved questions, edit question, tags, saved questions by tag and search</li>
  <li>RESTful routing using React Router</li>
  <li>use of Redux middleware to control state - I used this except for managing the values of controlled forms before submission</li>
  <li>async actions with fetch requests using Redux Thunk</li>
  <li>Rails API with standard JavaScript <code>fetch</code> syntax (not jQuery)</li>
  <li>display handled by front-end</li>
  <li>styling</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout my Flatiron journey, I tended to have an initial sense of challenge about the projects and their requirements, not least because they often require putting together a number of different elements that the taught curriculum has covered
  in isolation. However, despite the challenge, I've always pushed myself to make a useable product and in the process learn new stuff as my idea would organically evolve during the development process. As a result, I end up feeling pretty confident
  by
  the end of each project, not only in want I've learnt through the curriculum, but in full-stack development and coding more broadly. Now it's time to advance the challenge one step further as I start looking for opportunities to pursue a
  professional career in coding.</p>
