<p>You three just out of a first Monday-back meeting
<br>Projecting your voices in the middle of the open-plan office
<br>Standing because you have places to be: no time for seating</p>

<p>Talking baby and house, middle class palaver</p>

<p class="poem-indent">Mundane</p>

<p>Careful speech like a tightly-choreographed ballet</p>

<p class="poem-indent">Mundane</p>

<p>You want everyone to hear but youâ€™re so</p>

<p class="poem-indent">Mundane</p>

<p>+1 networking
<br>+1 status
<br>+1 sense of importance
<br>-1 human</p>
