<p>It's been a while.
<br>Last time was after the gender conference</p>

<p>Today it was walking alone on my way home late at night
<br>I'm wearing a pink skirt, but I have it concealed by a muted pink coat
<br>More baby pink leggings are showing, along with my pink hair
<br>I notice a group of four heading in the opposite direction across the street
<br>One has a bike – I’m fast, but I can’t outrun a bike
<br>I put my phone away, look straight ahead and walk with purpose</p>

<p>"Are you a boy or a girl?" one very probably cis woman shouts from the group
<br>"No", I think to myself as I continue walking, gaze unshifted
<br>"Batty boy" they conclude</p>

<p>I want to look over my shoulder in case the one on the bike could be creeping up on me, but turning around may provoke them
<br>I continue</p>

<p>Two minutes later...</p>

<p>"You're a pretty girl" shouts a very probably cis woman sitting across the street
<br>I don't know if they're mocking or being genuine
<br>"(something something) Katie Price"</p>

<p>I walk</p>

<p>I survive</p>

<p>But for how long?</p>
