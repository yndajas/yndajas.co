<h2>Teaching</h2>
<h4>Queen Mary University of London</h4>

<h5>Sounds of English</h5>
<p>Teaching Associate, autumn term 2017/18<br>Module leader: <a href="https://www.adamjchong.com" target="_blank">Dr Adam J. Chong</a></p>
<p>This was a level four phonetics and phonology module (not limited to English, contrary to the title). I did the majority of the marking and also shadowed teaching.</p>

<h4>York St John University</h4>

<h5>Sociolinguistics</h5>
<p>Teaching Associate, spring term 2015/16<br>Module leader: <a href="https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/schools/languages-linguistics/staff-profiles/academic-staff-profiles/dr-andrew-john-merrison/dr-andrew-john-merrison.html" target="_blank">Dr Andrew John Merrison</a></p>
<p class="before-list">This was a level five module. I supported and shadowed the delivery the module, which involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>thematically summarising weekly online (virtual learning environment) discussions (around 850 individual posts) from the previous academic year to serve as a focus-enhancing pedagogic tool for the 2015/16 cohort;</li>
  <li>providing (methodological and theoretical) advice to students on ideas for short research projects;</li>
  <li>contributing to and shadowing the facilitation of four two-hour seminar sessions;</li>
  <li>posing questions in response to and shadowing the management of student presentations.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Phonetics and Phonology</h5>
<p>Guest Lecturer, spring term 2015/16<br>Module leader: <a href="https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/schools/languages-linguistics/staff-profiles/academic-staff-profiles/nikki-swift---------------------------" target="_blank">Nikki Swift</a></p>
<p>This was a level five module. I delivered a two-hour workshop on acoustic phonetics, which included a short presentation followed by a series of interactive exercises progressively introducing different functions in Praat. For the latter I provided <a href="/assets/resources/Praatbasics_handout.pdf" target="_blank">this handout</a> [<a href="/citation">citation note</a>].</p>

<h4>Non-academic</h4>

<p>I've also delivered training on a couple of non-academic topics. With <a href="http://kitheyam.com" target="_blank">Dr Kit Heyam</a>, I provided training on binary and non-binary trans identities to University of Leeds medicine students and York St John University academic and administrative staff. At Queen Mary University of London I've twice delivered training on creating an multi-page academic profile/website using WordPress.com, once at GradFest 2017 and once within the Department of Linguistics. For the latter I created <a href="/assets/resources/academic_profile_WordPress-com_guide.pdf" target="_blank">this step-by-step guide</a> [<a href="/citation">citation note</a>]. Iâ€™ve also provided a lot of informal training on technical skills to colleagues throughout my career.</p>
