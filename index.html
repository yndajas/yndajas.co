<p>I'm a queer non-binary transfemme activist, socialist, creative, lapsed academic and developing coder. I started Non-binary London and York LGBTQ+ History month and - in non-COVID times - coordinate the DJs at the iconic weekly queer cabaret event Bar Wotever (at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern). I also dabble in poetry and music production and play tennis and video games.</p>


<!-- <p class="before-list">I'm a queer non-binary activist, academic and creative. I'm a second-year PhD candidate in (socio)linguistics at Queen Mary University of London with a particular interest in how we use speech to convey parts of our identity (i.e. gender and/or sexuality) in context-dependent ways. I'm also:</p>
