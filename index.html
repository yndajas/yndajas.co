<p class="before-list">I'm a queer non-binary activist, academic and creative. I'm a second-year PhD candidate in (socio)linguistics at Queen Mary University of London with a particular interest in how we use speech to convey parts of our identity (i.e. gender and/or sexuality) in context-dependent ways. I'm also:</p>

  <li>the founder of <a href="http://nonbinary.london" target="_blank">Non-binary London</a>, which exists to create and enable spaces both online and in person for non-binary people in London to connect with each other;</li>
  <li>lead DJ at <a href="https://woteverworld.com" target="_blank">Wotever World</a>'s Bar Wotever, a progressive and often radical weekly queer cabaret event with non-binary people highly visible on stage, behind the scenes and in the audience;</li>
  <li>part of <a href="https://twitter.com/CissexismDaily" target="_blank">Everyday Cissexism</a>, a Twitter-based campaign inspired by Everyday Sexism which highlights instances of cissexism and challenges organisations in particular to better support and include binary and non-binary trans people.</li>
