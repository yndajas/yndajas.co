<h2>Activism</h2>
<h4>Present</h4>
<p class="before-list">I've been involved in activism since my undergraduate days. Currently I'm focusing on community-building, solidarity, visibility and inclusion. I'm:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the founder of <a href="http://nonbinary.london" target="_blank">Non-binary London</a>, which exists to create and enable spaces both online and in person for non-binary people in London to connect with each other;</li>
  <li>part of <a href="https://twitter.com/CissexismDaily" target="_blank">Everyday Cissexism</a>, a Twitter-based campaign inspired by Everyday Sexism which highlights instances of cissexism and challenges organisations in particular to better support and include binary and non-binary trans people;</li>
  <li>founder, former lead coordinator and now assitant coordinator (from a distance) of <a href="https://yorklgbthistory.org.uk" target="_blank">York LGBT History Month</a>, a charity that seeks to promote local LGBT history and LGBT history locally, primarily through a large collaborative festival of events throughout February (typically comprised of around 50 events).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Past</h4>
<p class="before-list">Other organisations with which I’ve had substantial activist involvement in the past include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.yorksj.ac.uk/lgbt" target="_blank">York St John University LGBT Staff Network</a> as co-founder and secretary for the first few years (more detail on the <a href="/professional">professional experience</a> page);</li>
<li><a href="https://yorkvegans.co.uk" target="_blank">York Vegans</a>/York VegFest as vice chair for a short period, preparing a simple website ready for development and gathering best practice guidance from similar organisations across the country;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yorkpride.org.uk/" target="_blank">York Pride</a>, first as secretary in its first few years as an independent entity, then later for a short period as a support officer;</li>
<li><a href="https://yorklgbtforum.org.uk/" target="_blank">York LGBT Forum</a> as secretary for a little over a year;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yorkgsa.org/" target="_blank">University of York Graduate Students’ Association</a> - a students’ union specifically serving postgraduates at the University of York - as a student trustee;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ysjsu.com/" target="_blank">York St John Students' Union</a>, in various roles including volunteering officer/union councillor;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yorkmind.org.uk/" target="_blank">York Mind</a>, producing videos on mental health;</li>
<li>Rogue Frame Productions [now defunct], supporting the production of music videos and a short film.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also stood as a local election candidate in York’s Guildhall ward for the Green Party in the 2015 local elections and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/City_of_York_Council_election,_2015#/Guildhall_Ward" target="_blank">came scarily close to election</a>! I'd been involved in York Green Party since 2012, previously helping out with work including canvassing and leaflet design. I remained involved in the national LGBTIQ Greens committee as a non-portfolio member until August 2016. These days I’m more of a non-partisan radical/far-left socialist, aware of flaws in all major political parties and in (the reality of) party politics itself.</p>
